This is a lockheed martin stock predictor. 
However, I'm not focusing too much on the machine learning algorithm or the mathematical operations.

This project is less of a predictor but a prediction engine, it efficiently simulates a stream of stock data and powerfully processes it. 

```cpp
circularDeque<data> slide; 
```
